# Flutter-Developer-Journey
This repo is for show casing my projects as a flutter developer and some projects which I developed for practicing different concepts of flutter development fpr mobile platforms.
As I have previous experience in developing android application using Java and Kotlin switching to flutter was bit easy.
So far I loved the framework as whole. Here are some projects that I developed for practicing different concepts in flutter.
